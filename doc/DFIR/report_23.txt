title: SQL Brute Force Leads to BlueSky Ransomware---

In December 2022, we observed an intrusion on a public-facing MSSQL Server, which resulted in BlueSky ransomware. First discovered in
June 2022
, BlueSky ransomware has code links to
Conti and Babuk
ransomware.
While
other reports
point to malware downloads as initial access, in this report the threat actors gained access via a MSSQL brute force attack. They then leveraged Cobalt Strike and Tor2Mine to perform post-exploitation activities. Within one hour of the threat actors accessing the network, they deployed BlueSky ransomware network wide.
Case Summary
In the month of December 2022, we observed a cluster of activity targeting MSSQL servers. The activity started with brute force password attempts for the MS SQL “sa” (System Administrator) account on an internet facing server. Upon successfully discovering the password, the threat actors enabled “xp_cmdshell” on the SQL server. The “xp_cmdshell” allows users with sysadmin privilege to execute shell commands on the host.
Using “xp_cmdshell” the threat actors first executed a PowerShell command on the SQL server. The command contained base64 encoded content, which, upon execution, established a connection to a Cobalt Strike command and control server. This activity was immediately followed by injection into the legitimate process winlogon. The injected process then spawned PowerShell and cmd to perform SMB scans and discovery using
SMBexec
.
The PowerShell session was then seen making a connection to a Tor2Mine stager server. This was followed by execution of a PowerShell script which performed a variety of operations, such as checking privileges of the active user, disabling of AV solutions, and dropping of a miner payload named java.exe.
Tor2Mine
is a Monero-mining campaign that is based on XMRigCC. Depending upon the privileges of the user, the script also performs creation of scheduled tasks and Windows services to maintain persistence on the host.
Around 15 minutes after initial access, the threat actors then moved laterally toward domain controllers and file shares using remote service creation. These services were used to execute the same PowerShell commands, download and execute the Tor2Mine malware. Upon establishing access to one of the domain controllers the threat actors performed similar activity as observed on the beachhead.
After roughly 30 minutes after initial access, the BlueSky ransomware binary was dropped and executed on the beachhead. The execution worked as intended which resulted in the ransomware spreading to all devices in the network over SMB. The time to ransomware in this case was 32 minutes.
Threat Actor Profile:
Cobalt Strike
The Cobalt Strike server observed in this intrusion was first observed on December 16th 2022 and remained active through January 17th 2023. We saw the server then return for a second time frame from April 6th 2023 though April 15th 2023. This data was provided via the
Threat Intel tracking services
of The DFIR Report.
Tor2Mine
The PowerShell scripts involved in this case as well as infrastructure for the Tor2Mine server were observed being reused in May 2023 with the PaperCut NG
CVE-2023-27350
exploit as the initial access source. In that intrusion no ransomware was observed. The linked case data is available for

Initial Access
The initial access occurred via a brute-force attack, where the threat actors mainly targeted the System Admin (“sa”) account.
During the intrusion, we observed over 10,000 failed attempts before successful login.
SQL Server event ID 18456 Failure Audit Events in the Windows application logs:
Successful Login:
Execution
In the next attack stage, the threat actors established a command shell via Extended SQL Stored Procedure (
xp_cmdshell
). This process allows you to issue operating system commands directly to the Windows command shell. To do this they enabled the feature the MSSQL configuration:
The threat actor then executed a Cobalt Strike beacon and a PowerShell script that has previously been identified
by Sophos
as used in campaigns to deploy Tor2Mine malware.
The overall execution events are depicted in the below diagram:
The first PowerShell script executed a command to download a Cobalt Strike beacon.
This was followed by a second PowerShell execution for:
A connection was then established with the following Tor2Mine server and URIs:
Tor2Mine uses a PowerShell script checking.ps1 to perform variety of operations. The script first sets a variable named $priv and $osver to check whether the active user is an administrator and the operating system version respectively, in the first few lines.
It then attempts to pull down an additional script named kallen.ps1, a PowerShell version of mimikatz from the Tor2Mine server.
It also consists of a function named “StopAV”, where it tries to disable antivirus solutions – in this case, MalwareBytes, Sophos and Windows Defender.
Depending upon the result of the $priv variable, there are 2 routes for the script: Privileged ”PrivTrue()“ and Non-Privileged “PrivFalse()”.
If the user is a privileged user, it first checks for the OS architecture, then downloads appropriate version (in our case, x64) of the miner and installs it as java.exe, in the “C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java” directory. It also installs a driver named WinRing0x64.sys.
The function also creates multiple scheduled tasks and services which have references to Tor2Mine miner java.exe, encoded PowerShell commands and .hta files hosted on Tor2Mine servers.
In the case of the non-privileged function “PrivFalse()”, it executes a batch script “PrivFalse.bat” as scheduled tasks and also sets up schtasks as seen in the “PrivTrue()” function.
In the last section, a script named del.ps1 is downloaded and executed on the host as a scheduled task. The del.ps1 script has been explored further in the Defense Evasion section.
Depending upon the output of the $priv variable, the execution flow is as follows:
As the mimi function is commented, we didn’t observe any artifacts related to kallen.ps1 script.
Persistence
To establish persistence in the network, multiple scheduled tasks and Windows services were created on the beachhead and one of the domain controllers. They reference the files dropped on the compromised hosts and Tor2Mine servers.
Privilege Escalation
The threat actor was seen injecting code into legitimate process winlogon.exe via CreateRemoteThread which can be detected using Sysmon event ID 8.
During the intrusion the threat actor deployed XMrig miner which loaded the driver
WinRing0
. This driver is deployed to assist the miner in operations and has been in use since at least
version 5.3.0
.
Defense Evasion
The Windows Defender AV Real-Time Monitoring was disabled on the beachhead and one of the domain controllers using Set-MpPreference cmdlet.
The PowerShell script, checking.ps1, is explained in the Execution section which contained other ways to disable AV, including registry modifications and service disabling.
A PowerShell script named del.ps1 attempts to terminate system utilities such as Process Explorer, Task Manager, Process Monitor, and Daphne Task Manager.
In the script
checking.ps1
the threat actor created 16 different tasks on the hosts where Tor2Mine was deployed. These tasks were named in a manner to try and blend in with various Windows tasks that on the hosts:
\Microsoft\Windows\MUI\LPupdate
\Microsoft\Windows\RamDiagnostic\Error Diagnostic

Credential Access
Tor2Mine was used to access the LSASS memory space and the access granted was 0x1010.
On the beachhead, we observed the execution of credential dumping utility
Invoke-PowerDump.
Discovery
During the course of the intrusion, we observed port discovery (port 445) activity from the beachhead. We attribute this to the invocation of the PowerShell command Invoke-SMBExec. This was likely executed as part of the
Invoke-TheHash
framework based on other PowerShell modules observed.
Looking at the traffic from a network perspective we observed the activity making DCE\RPC calls to the svcctl endpoint and the named pipe \pipe\ntsvcs using the OpenSCManagerW operation.
This appeared to be how they profiled the network layout and remote hosts.
The threat actor was observed running
whoami
from the Tor2Mine PowerShell process on the beachhead.
"C:\Windows\system32\whoami.exe" /user
Lateral Movement
The threat actors moved laterally toward the domain controllers and file shares using Remote Service creation. The pattern “%COMSPEC% /C “cmd /c powershell.exe” is associated with the Cobalt Strike “psexec_psh” jump module.
Decoding the command we can see the same PowerShell download and execute as observed on the beachhead. The hexadecimal value 0x53611451 corresponds to the IP address 83.97.20[.]81 which was the command and control server for the Tor2Mine malware.

Impact
The BlueSky ransomware binary named
vmware.exe
was dropped on the beachhead, which upon execution, resulted in network wide ransomware. This was accomplished using SMB with the ransomware connecting to host over port 445 to encrypt files.
The files were renamed with the file extension .bluesky and a ransom note file named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt was dropped on the host and opened to reveal the ransom note.
On the beachhead server, the time of encryption was visible as the MSSQL service stopped functioning after execution of
vmware.exe
:
The whole intrusion after initial access lasted only around 30 minutes with limited discovery and no exfiltration observed.
