title: HTML Smuggling Leads to Domain Wide Ransomware---

We’ve previously reported on a
Nokoyawa ransomware case
in which the initial access was via an Excel macro and IcedID malware. This case, which also ended in Nokoyawa Ransomware, involved the threat actor deploying the final ransomware only 12 hours after the initial compromise.
This threat actor delivered a password protected ZIP file via
HTML smuggling
to organizations back in late October, early November 2022. Within the password protected ZIP file, there was an ISO file that deployed IcedID which led to the use of Cobalt Strike and ultimately
Nokoyawa ransomware
. This intrusion also overlaps with the previous
Nokoyawa ransomware case
.

Case Summary
In early November 2022, the intrusion began with the delivery of an HTML file. We assess with high confidence that the delivery was via email, as reported in other
public reports
. This HTML file was using a technique known as HTML smuggling. This is one of the techniques threat actors have pivoted to since macro control defaults were updated by Microsoft. Just a month prior, this threat actor was observed using Excel macros in an extremely
similar campaign
.
Upon the user opening the HTML file, a fake Adobe page was presented and a ZIP file was downloaded. The Adobe lure includes a password for the ZIP as a way to protect the malicious contents from automated analysis. Inside the ZIP was an ISO file. Inside the ISO was the malware payload. The only visible file to the user was a LNK file masquerading as a document.
When the user clicked the LNK file, a series of commands were then executed. These included copying rundll32 and a malicious DLL from within the ISO to the host, before executing the malware. After loading the malicious DLL, a connection was made to IcedID command and control servers. The user meanwhile was served a legitimate image of a finance document.
When the malicious DLL was executed, persistence was also established via a scheduled task on the beachhead host. This task was set to run the IcedID malware every hour on the host. Initial discovery commands were ran seconds after reaching out to the command and control server. These commands have been seen in
previous reports
involving IcedID, including standard utilities like net, ipconfig, systeminfo, and nltest.
Around three hours after execution of the initial IcedID malware, a cmd process was spawned from IcedID. This new process began beaconing to a Cobalt Strike server. This Cobalt Strike server was previously observed in a prior
Nokoyawa report
. This process was then observed accessing LSASS, likely to access credentials. A quick check of domain admins using net was also observed.
Hands-on activity then paused for around three hours before the threat actor returned. Using the Cobalt Strike beacon, the threat actor looked up specific domain administrators using the net utility. Using one of those accounts, the threat actor initiated a RDP session to move laterally to a domain controller. Using this session, the threat actor copied over a Cobalt Strike beacon to the domain controller and executed it.
After that, the threat actor continued discovery actions by executing a batch file on the domain controller, which ran the usual battery of Active Directory discovery commands using AdFind. Upon completion, the results of the discovery commands were archived using 7-Zip. This was followed by the threat actor running a second batch file, which iterated through the network performing a nslookup for each host in the environment.
About five hours later, the threat actor returned to the domain controller and executed an encoded PowerShell command which was SessionGopher. SessionGopher is a tool that finds and decrypts saved session information for remote access tools. The threat actor then logged into additional hosts over RDP, including a backup server and a server with file shares. On the backup server, the threat actor opened the backup console. While on the file share, they used notepad to review a file on the host.
The threat actor returned to the domain controller and utilized netscan to perform a network scan. After the scan, both PsExec and WMIC were used to move files across systems in the network. Key files copied included k.exe and p.bat. These two files were the ransomware binary and a batch script that would be used to execute the ransomware.
Five minutes after transferring the files to hosts in the domain, the Nokoyawa ransomware binary was executed on a domain controller. At the same time, PsExec was used to execute the p.bat file starting the ransomware binary on the other hosts in the domain. The time to ransomware (TTR) was just over 12 hours from the initial infection.
Attribution
In this case we see two different threat actors; the distributor and the hands on keyboard actor. Proofpoint tracks this distributor as
TA551
. The hands on keyboard actor is tracked by Microsoft as Storm-0390 which is a “pen test” team managed by
Periwinkle Tempest
(formerly tracked as Storm-0193 and DEV-0193).
The ransomware affiliate is seen RDPing into the environment from server name WIN-5J00ETD85P5. This server name matches the one used by a threat actor from a
prior Nokoyawa case
. We can see from internet scanning tools, this hostname is currently active on 78.128.113[.]154 hosted on AS209160 Miti2000 at 4vendeta.com in Bulgaria.

Initial Access
For this campaign, thread hijacked emails were used to deliver the malicious HTML file. According to Proofpoint, this campaign was associated to a distribution group they track as TA551. Credits to Proofpoint for the below example.
After downloading and opening the HTML file, it downloaded a password protected ZIP file with a random name. The password to unzip the file was presented to the user.
The following image shows the HTML file opened in a browser.
The ISO file from the zip, when mounted, had 1 visible LNK file (documents-9771) and 3 hidden files: demurest.cmd, pimpliest_kufic.png and templates544.png.
After execution, a legitimate image is opened to trick the user into thinking nothing is amiss.
Execution
The ISO file contained a LNK file, with an icon of an Image, which prompted the user to click on it.When the user opened the LNK file, the batch script demurest.cmd was executed.
The batch script in the demurest.cmd file did the following:
Opened pimpliest_kufic.png, which displayed an image.
The Windows utility xcopy was used to copy rundll32.exe to %temp%\entails.exe.
Created string “templates544.png” on the runtime and copied it with a random number with a format: RANDOM_NUM.RANDOM_NUM.
templates544.png was an IcedID DLL and was executed via entails.exe.
We can see from memory (
MemProcFS
), cmd executes entails.exe, which executes the IcedID dll by looking at the CommandLine. We can also see the call chain of cmd->entails.exe with a grand parent process of explorer.exe
Around six hours into the intrusion, 1.dll (Cobalt Strike) was dropped on the beachhead host before being copied to a domain controller. After 1.dll was transferred to the domain controller, it was executed via rundll32.exe via following command:
rundll32.exe 1.dll, DllRegisterServer
Persistence
IcedID registered a scheduled task to gain persistence on the beachhead host, which ran every hour.

Privilege Escalation
The compromised user had local administrative privileges on their machine which allowed the threat actor to leverage tools requiring higher permissions.
Defense Evasion
Looking at the contents of the malicious HTML file, we can pick out the HTML smuggling in the code. First, looking at the
<script>
tags we come to the following:
If we take that data blob, decode the contents with base64, and export that into a file, we can find the zipped ISO file hidden in the document:
The PK header indicates the data is the start of a
zip file
, and the following data reveals the contents to be an ISO file.
The initial access package from the threat actor used the Windows xcopy utility to rename rundll32.exe to entails.exe. This was likely to evade detection logic based around command line execution. Entails.exe, which loaded the IcedID DLL, was then observed injecting into a cmd.exe process on the beachhead host.
Below we can see the IcedID loader in memory in the entails.exe process:

The entails.exe process first opened cmd.exe with the GrantedAccess of 0x1fffff, which maps to
PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS
rights, followed by a call to CreateRemoteThread, which was recorded by Sysmon Event ID 10 and 8 respectively as shown below:

cmd.exe
The injected cmd.exe, in turn, injected into rundll32.exe.
Credential Access
It appears Cobalt Strike was used to access the LSASS memory space. The access granted was 0x1010 & 0x1fffff. These access patterns were also seen in previous reports
here
and
here
. These values can be used to identify
credential access
.
Pipes were created with the default Cobalt Strike prefix of ‘postex_’
On one of the domain controllers, an encoded PowerShell command was observed being executed from a Cobalt Strike beacon.
This command, once decoded, revealed the execution of the
SessionGopher script
.
IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:8897/'); Invoke-SessionGopher
Discovery
After loading IcedID DLL via the renamed rundll32, the following discovery commands were observed on the beachhead host:
cmd.exe /c chcp >&2
ipconfig /all
systeminfo
net config workstation
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
net view /all /domain
net view /all
net group "Domain Admins" /domain
As a part of discovery commands, IcedID used WMI to get the list of Anti-Virus product installed on the beachhead host with the following command:
WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get * /Format:List
The threat actor also ran the following discovery commands via cmd.exe (injected Beacon process):
net  group "domain admins" /domain
net  user [REDACTED DOMAIN ADMIN] /domain
net  user Administrator /domain
net  user [REDACTED DOMAIN ADMIN] /domain
cmd.exe /C dir *.txt
cmd.exe /C dir *.dll
AdFind was used for discovery on a domain controller via a batch script named adfind.bat. The script executed the following commands:
adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=person) >  ad_users.txt
adfind.exe -f objectcategory=computer > ad_computers.txt
adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit) > ad_ous.txt
adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet) > ad_subnets.txt
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)" > ad_group.txt
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp >  ad_trustdmp.txt
7.exe a -mx3 ad.7z ad_*
del 7.exe adfind* ad_*
After running this, the threat actor dropped a new batch file ns.bat. This file contained a list of hosts on the network to perform DNS lookups using nslookup.
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C ns.bat
nslookup [REDACTED HOST X]
...
nslookup [REDACTED HOST XX]
Shortly before beginning the ransomware deployment, the threat actor connected to a backup server and opened the backup console on the host. This was followed by final discovery action on the domain controller with the
SoftPerfect Netscan
tool being used for a final discovery scan across the network.
Lateral Movement
The threat actor connected to various hosts in the network via RDP tunneled through the beacon process on the beachhead host.
We can find the hostname of the threat actor present in some of the Windows logs, event ID’s 4624, 4776, 4778, and 4779.
WIN-5J00ETD85P5
The workstation name observed in a 4624 event on the beachhead:
Seen again in a 4776 event from a domain controller:
And again in 4778 followed by 4779 on the domain controller:
During the RDP session, 1.dll (Cobalt Strike DLL) was transferred from the beachhead via the Windows File Explorer.
Similarly, the final files used to execute the ransomware deployment were transferred in the same manner, which can be seen via the file creation logging process being Explorer.EXE.
Once k.exe and p.bat, and various other batch scripts were transferred to the compromised domain controller, the threat actor then tried to copy k.exe to other machines on the network via
copy
command executed on the domain controller.
This command execution may not have worked properly, or as backup the threat actor ran the copy command again, but this time instead of executing cmd
/K copy
on the domain controller they ran wmic to execute the copy command from the remote host’s instead.
This process was repeated for p.bat, this repetition makes it likely that this was scripted out rather than a failed execution of the copy process.
First, copy command issued on domain controller:
Second, copy command with WMIC for remote hosts to run the command.
Once both k.exe and p.bat were copied to the machines in the network, the threat actor used PsExec.exe to remotely create a service named
mstdc
to run p.bat (p.bat runs k.exe, which encrypts the system based on the Base64 encoded config) via System account.
Each host on the receiving end of PsExec has a ‘.key’ file created. The filename contains the hostname of the machine that initiated PsExec.
Collection
After AdFind had finished executing, the results were archived utilizing 7-Zip.
Command and Control
IcedID
Once entails.exe (rundll32.exe) successfully executed templates544.png on the beachhead host, an outbound connection was established talking to trentonkaizerfak[.]com.
This downloaded a gzip file for the next IcedID stage. After executing this payload, command and control was established to 5.255.103[.]16

Cobalt Strike
After the injection into cmd.exe on the beachhead host, 1.dll (Cobalt Strike DLL) was created, which later was transferred to the domain controller. Then, 1.dll was executed on the domain controller via rundll32.exe and after execution, rundll32.exe connected to the command and control server 5.8.18[.]242. This server was observed in a
prior case
, which also resulted in Nokoyawa ransomware.

Impact
The threat actor was seen deploying Nokoyawa ransomware throughout the environment utilizing both PSExec & WMIC.
psexec.exe \\[TARGET IP] -u [DOMAIN]\[USER] -p "[PASSWORD]" -s -d -h -r mstdc -accepteula -nobanner c:\windows\temp\p.bat
wmic /node:"[TARGET IP]" /user:"[DOMAIN]\[USER]" /password:"[PASSWORD]" process call create "cmd.exe /c c:\windows\temp\p.bat"
This duplication of execution using both PsExec and WMIC mirrors the doubled commands used to copy files throughout the network, indicating scripted execution for redundancy.
The batch file (p.bat) is responsible for executing the ransomware binary (k.exe) along with its configurations.
c:\windows\temp\k.exe --config REDACTED
Upon reviewing the configuration provided in the command parameters, this particular ransomware is configured to encrypt the network, load hidden drives, and delete volume shadow copies.
Furthermore, the configuration informs the ransomware binary to skip the following directories and file extensions.
